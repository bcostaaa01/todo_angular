# todo_angular
This is a project which comprises of a Todo list app, built with the Angular.js framework.

In this ToDo list app, I have used the Angular controller attribute.

1. index.html: 

- Basic HTML template
- Add ToDoList to the index.html file with the ng-app attribute
- Create a div to store the items in the list and ng-repeat to iterate over them
- Add input element to allow the user to write input content
- Add button elemetn to allow the user to submit the content
- Import app.js
- Import mainController.js

2. App.js:

- Create app variable and assign an Angular Module to it ("ToDoList"), with no dependencies

3. mainController.js

- Create controller with a scope object 
- Create a list with an empty array, on the scope object
- Create addItem and assign an anonymous function to access the list, on the scope object, and push items to it, using addToDo on the scope object

This is about it.

Thank you for looking at my code and happy coding!
